  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  # STEP 1 — Tests (the most critical check)
  # Builds the project and runs all unit +
  # integration tests via cargo test.
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Install the Rust toolchain declared in rust-toolchain.toml (if present),
      # otherwise falls back to stable.
      - name: Install Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable

      # Cache compiled dependencies so subsequent runs are faster.
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2

      # cargo test also compiles the project, so no separate `cargo build` needed.
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  # STEP 2 — Code Coverage
  # Uses cargo-tarpaulin to measure how much of
  # the application code is exercised by tests.
  # Reports are uploaded to Codecov for tracking
  # over time. Only runs on Linux (tarpaulin
  # only supports x86_64 Linux at this time).
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  coverage:
    name: Code Coverage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2

      # Install tarpaulin as a cargo subcommand.
      - name: Install cargo-tarpaulin
        run: cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

      # --ignore-tests excludes test functions themselves from coverage stats,
      # so we only measure production application code.
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  # STEP 3 — Linting (clippy)
  # clippy is Rust's official linter. It catches
  # unidiomatic code, overly complex constructs,
  # and common mistakes that the compiler alone
  # won't flag.
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # We need the `clippy` component explicitly —
      # CI runners often use the minimal rustup profile which omits it.
      - name: Install Rust + clippy
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          components: clippy

      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2

      # -D warnings turns every clippy warning into a hard error,
      # so the pipeline fails on any linting issue.
      - name: Run clippy
        run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  # STEP 4 — Formatting (rustfmt)
  # Enforces a consistent code style across the
  # whole team. Reviewers can focus on logic and
  # architecture instead of formatting nitpicks.
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  fmt:
    name: Format
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # We need the `rustfmt` component explicitly.
      - name: Install Rust + rustfmt
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          components: rustfmt

      # --check does NOT reformat files — it exits with a non-zero
      # code and prints a diff if anything is unformatted, failing the pipeline.
      - name: Check formatting
        run: cargo fmt -- --check

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  # STEP 5 — Security Audit (cargo-audit)
  # Scans every crate in the dependency tree
  # against the RustSec Advisory Database.
  # Runs on every commit AND on the daily schedule
  # defined above, so we catch new vulnerabilities
  # even in projects we're not actively changing.
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  security:
    name: Security Audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Exits non-zero (failing the pipeline) if any
      # dependency has a known, unresolved vulnerability.
      - name: Audit dependencies
        run: cargo audit
